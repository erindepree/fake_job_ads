    abstract = "Open-source software packages for language processing often include stop word lists. Users may apply them without awareness of their surprising omissions (e.g. ``hasn{'}t'' but not ``hadn{'}t'') and inclusions ({``}computer''), or their incompatibility with a particular tokenizer. Motivated by issues raised about the Scikit-learn stop list, we investigate variation among and consistency within 52 popular English-language stop lists, and propose strategies for mitigating these issues."
